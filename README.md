# Breast-Cancer-Detection-using-Deep-Neural-Networks
Breast cancer is a serious health concern worldwide, particularly among women. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment and improved survival rates. Traditional diagnostic methods can be time-consuming and prone to human error. This project aims to leverage the power of Machine Learning and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to build a classification model that can accurately detect whether a tumor is benign or malignant based on various diagnostic features.
